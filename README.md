# Discord bot

My first public project that I've been working on, now and then, since I started programming a couple months ago.

One of the functions is based on the [mplsoccer](https://github.com/andrewRowlinson/mplsoccer) library which will take a player name input, parse fbref.com for some statistics and then outputs a pie chart.

Example output:

<img src="data/player.png" width="600" height="600">
